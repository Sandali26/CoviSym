# CoviSym
CoviSym is a Covid19 Detection Model to carry out a fundamental task through an image classification model that divides chest X-Ray scans into three classes: Normal, Viral, and COVID. On a COVID-19 dataset, the ResNet-18 model has great classification results for X-ray images and Pytorch, an open-source ML environment, will be used .
