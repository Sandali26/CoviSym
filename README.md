# CoviSym
CoviSym is a Covid19 Detection Model to carry out a fundamental task through an image classification model that divides chest X-Ray scans into three classes: Normal, Viral, and COVID. On a COVID-19 dataset, the ResNet-18 model has great classification results for X-ray images and Pytorch, an open-source ML environment, will be used . Through a series of steps—diagnosis, prepossessing, segmentation, and feature extraction—different datasets on medical imaging will be compared and studied. This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a COVID-19 detection model using chest X-rays. The model is built using the ResNet-18 architecture and is trained on a publicly available dataset of chest X-rays that includes COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal images.
